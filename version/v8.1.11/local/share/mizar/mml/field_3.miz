Th1:
  for n being Nat holds n = { m where m is Nat : m < n } by AXIOMS:4;

theorem Th2:
  for n being Nat, x being object st n = {x} holds x = 0
   proof
     let n be Nat, x be object;
     assume
A1:  n = {x}; then
     card n = 1 by CARD_1:30; then
     x in {0} by A1,CARD_1:49,TARSKI:def 1;
     hence thesis by TARSKI:def 1;
   end;

theorem Th3:
  for n being Nat, x,y being object st n = {x,y} & x <> y
    holds (x = 0 & y = 1) or (x = 1 & y = 0)

   proof
     let n be Nat;

     let R be Ring, n be non zero Nat;
     defpred P[Nat] means power(R).(0.R,$1) = 0.R;
     power(R).(0.R,0+1) = power(R).(0.R,0) * 0.R by GROUP_1:def 7 .= 0.R; then
