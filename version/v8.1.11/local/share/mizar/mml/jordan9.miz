theorem
  C is connected implies
 for n being Nat holds N-min L~Cage(C,n) = (Cage(C,n))/.1
proof
  assume
A1: C is connected;
  let n be Nat;
  set f = Cage(C,n);
A2: for k being Nat st 1 <= k & k+1 <= len f
  holds left_cell(f,k,Gauge(C,n)) misses C
  & right_cell(f,k,Gauge(C,n)) meets C by A1,Th31;
  f is_sequence_on Gauge(C,n) &
  ex i being Nat st 1 <= i & i+1 <= len Gauge(C,n ) &
f/.1 = Gauge(C,n)*(i,width Gauge(C,n)) & f/.2 = Gauge(C,n)*(i+1,width Gauge(C,n
